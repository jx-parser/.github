# About jx

jx (short for JSON eXtended, file extension `.jx`) is a file format that extends [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). jx was designed specifically for configuration files, but has a wide range of potential applications. jx is a super-set of JSON that supports core JSON but adds many more powerful features. For example:
- Inline and block comments
- Keys without quotes
- Single and double quoted strings
- Equations
- Variables, functions and user-defined functions
- String, Array and Object operations (combine, add, remove etc)
- Color support and manipulation
- [Check out an example jx file](examples/example.jx)
